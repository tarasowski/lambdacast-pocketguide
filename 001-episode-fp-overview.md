* Functions as first class values means you can pass functions around as if they were strings, integers or any other value. You can declare them, pass them into function, return them from functions.

* Functional programming emphasizes pure functions.

* Imperative languages are time based. Step 1, Step 2, Step 3. The order of execution is important. Imperative is how to do.

* Declarative says what to do. SQL is a good example of an imperative language.
